# [Full Stack open 2021](https://fullstackopen.com/en/)

This repository contains worked solutions to exercises in the Full Stack open 2021 course.

The Full Stack open 2021 course is an introduction to modern web application development with JavaScript, offered by the University of Helsinki. The focus is on building a single page application with ReactJS using REST APIs built with NodeJS. The course covers testing, configuration and environment management, and using MongoDB for storing app data.

The course also covers more modern application technologies, including GraphQL and TypeScript.

## Part 3 - [Programming a server with NodeJs and Express](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part3)

Focuses on developing the backend, server-side of the stack.

The exercises implement a REST API in NodeJS using the Express library, and stores the application data in a MongoDB database.
The live application is deployed to heroku, and can be access via this link: https://blooming-brook-29966.herokuapp.com.

The solutions to this exercise are located in a separate repository:

## Part 4 - [Testing Express servers, user administration](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part4)

Expands on backend development by covering project file structure best practices, unit and integration tests, and implementing 
user authentication and authorization.

Exercises implement a REST API in NodeJS using Express, to serve as endpoints for a blog list application. User authentication and 
authorization are also implemented. Unit and Integration tests are included using Jest.

## Part 5 - [Testing React apps](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part5)

Returns to the frontend to cover testing React code, and implements token based authentication. 

Exercises develop the frontend for the blog list application. It demonstrates the use of token authentication, and implements
tests with Jest and end-to-end testing with Cypress.

## Part 6 - [State management with Redux](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part6)

Introduces centralised application state management with the Redux-library.

Exercises refactor previous assignments to use Redux hooks in state management, and demonstrates use of reducers, redux-thunk, 
and communicating with the server in a redux app. Also touches on the connect-function, an older approach to state management in Redux.

## Part 7 - [React router, custom hooks, styling app with CSS and webpack](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part7)

Covers a range of topics:
* Using React router to divide the application into different views based on the URL in the browser.
* Applying CSS-style components
* Webpack, and how to configure the application manually.
* Deeper look at hook-functions, and custom hooks.

Exercises expand the functionality of the blog list application, and includes other projects to demonstrate various concepts covered
in the subject.
